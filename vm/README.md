# apptron

Welcome to Apptron! This is just a tech demo right now, but Apptron is the
**first general development environment in the browser**. Codespaces? Replit? No, 
their development environments run in the *cloud*. Apptron runs entirely in the 
browser.

The file tree in the Explorer is the root filesystem of an Alpine Linux virtual
machine running on this page. The Terminal has a shell open in this VM. Any 
changes to the VM are autosaved locally every 10 seconds. This means you can 
customize the VM to add development tools or even clone a Git repository to 
work on.

All the components for this are open source, so you could easily build your own.
It's just a static site, so it's trivial to run and costs almost nothing.

More details will be put online soon, but in the meantime you can ask questions
or just stay up to date by sponsoring me on GitHub:
